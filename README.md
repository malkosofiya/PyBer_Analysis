# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The goal of this project is to create visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine weekly fares for each city type. PyBer operates in 3 major city types: urban, suburban, and rural. The analysis was created based on 5 main categories: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per driver. 

## Results

When analizing the summary dataframe, it's easy to spot that urban cities had the highest number of total rides and total fares whereas rural cities had the lowest number in those categories. In contrast, urban cities had the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver while rural cities had the higest with average fare per driver being $55.49. This trend can be easily explained by PyBer accessbility when inspecting driver count by city types. Urban cities had nearly 3 times more drivers in comparison to suburban cities and more than 30 times in comparison to rural cities.

The multiple-line graph displays PyBer performence for each city type in the span of 4 months. Overall, the weekly fare stayed consistant throughout the analysis with last week of February peaking for all city types.

## Summary

Based on the results, three business recommendations can be provided to PyBer:

* Rural Cities are underperformers in comparison to other city types. Investing in additional marketing and advertizing within rural cities can help to increase the number of total rides, consequently resulting in revenue growth. 

* To better understand city performance, Pyber should include milage per trip in their next data analysis. This could provide additional insight when analyzing average fares per cities. For example, urban cities usually tend to have shorter trips whereas rural cities might be longer based on their geographical positioning.

* When working on future marketing campaigns, it can be useful to understand weekly performance trends. For instance, the last week of February can be used for new promotions/marketing campaigns since all three cities peaked in total fares over this time period.
